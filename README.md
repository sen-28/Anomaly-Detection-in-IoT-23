# Anomaly-Detection-in-IoT-23

A comparative analysis of ML and DL models on the IoT-23 dataset for anomaly detection.

## Background

Anomaly detection is very similar to outlier analysis. It is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and observations that deviate from a dataset's normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as technical glitches, etc. The complex networks behind IoT and its increasing applicability in solving complex and everyday challenges make it highly prone to security failure and its enormous ramifications. Hence, anomaly detection is of utmost importance in the Internet of Things. 

## Literature Review 

The use of ML for IoT Detection is still relatively new. Although some frameworks have been developed, most research work focuses on implementation and testing. However, the scope of using ML and DL is immense in IoT since the devices are **less complex than traditional systems**, making them **more predictable**, and **data for analysis is readily available**. 

There are two significant ways of implementing ML algorithms in IoT networks:

- **Network-based**: Using metadata from the IoT network
- **Host-based**: Using the information present on the device

This project will be focused on a **network-based implementation of ML** while also performing classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)**.
